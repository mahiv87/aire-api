   "description": "Enjoy this 3.2-mile out-and-back trail near Estes Park, Colorado. Generally considered an easy route, it takes an average of 1 h 39 min to complete. This is a very popular area for hiking and snowshoeing, so you'll likely encounter other people while exploring. The best times to visit this trail are June through October. You'll need to leave pups at home â€” dogs aren't allowed on this trail.",
